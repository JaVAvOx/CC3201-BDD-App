# CC3201-BDD-App

App developed for CC3201 'Databases' course. Developed in collaboration with @23pablo97 (https://github.com/23pablo97)


This was a project based on a postgres database running on a temporary server (University server). We made it using Django + Bootstrap 4.

We have a Welcome page (Sorry for Spanish haha)

Then we have a page to preview each table (in 'Tablas' there was a dropdown menu) and you can update each row of a table.

A page to make some querys (three different querys and you can change the parameters)

And a page to insert new rows on each table (once again, in 'Insertar en tablas' there was a dropdown menu)
